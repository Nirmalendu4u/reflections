When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we want live collabaration, two or more people working on the same project from different location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because sometomes it can create undesirable conflicts. Pulling changes manually makes it sure that are ready to pull GitHub changes

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are done on github repository to create our own repository by forking someone elses repository. Use when you dont have access to edit a particular repo.
Branches are be created locally by labelling a commit. Use when you want to do a POC or add a big feature.
A clone of github repo can be creted on local. Use when you want to work offline.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
To resolve conflicts between local changes and remote changes

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
May be using SVN which is pretty similar like committing, merging, creating a branch etc.
Since, I have an experience with SVN, I find it easier. Harder would be merging two branches in the repo.
If I had to do it manually, I would have dropped the ball.
