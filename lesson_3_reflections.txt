When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we want live collabaration, two or more people working on the same project from different location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because sometomes it can create undesirable conflicts. Pulling changes manually makes it sure that are ready to pull GitHub changes
